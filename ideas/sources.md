# Source library (seed)

This file is a living list of sources used across the 20 idea briefs. Each brief will cite the subset it relies on.

Notes:
- Prefer **public-agency handbooks**, standards bodies, and peer-reviewed publications.
- When citing vendor pages, pair them with at least one public-agency or research source.
