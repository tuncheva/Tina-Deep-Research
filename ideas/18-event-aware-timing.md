# 18) Event-Aware Timing: Concert/Stadium/Festival Mode

## Brief Description
Event-aware timing activates special plans for demand surges from events or incidents.

## Analogical Reference
Like adjusting traffic for a parade, signals switch modes to handle crowd flows.

## Comprehensive Information
Detecting surges via thresholds, signals prioritize inbound/outbound movements with digital twin forecasting and rollback for safety.

## Upsides and Downsides

### Positive Aspects on People's Lives in 5 Years
- Efficient Events: Faster clearance reduces congestion and stress.
- Safety During Crowds: Predictable flows prevent chaos.

### Positive Aspects on People's Lives in 15 Years
- Smart Event Management: AI predicts and adapts to surges automatically.

### Downsides in 5 and 15 Years
- Complexity: Requires coordination and may disrupt normal traffic.
- Staffing Demands: Off-hours activation needs resources.

### Hard Things People Will Have to Overcome When Getting Used to It
- Surge Detection: Accurate triggers for various events.
- Multi-Agency Coordination: Integrating with event organizers.
- Smooth Transitions: Returning to normal operations.

## What it is (precise)
Event-aware timing detects demand surges from planned events, incidents, evacuations, activating special plans favoring inbound/outbound movements with monitoring and rollback. Digital twins forecast congestion, rank plans by KPIs, supporting safe workflows. NOCoE TIM case studies show automatic plan downloads for event corridors, improving clearance and reducing gridlock.

## Benefits
Improves event management:
- **Faster Clearance**: Pre-planned timings speed egress; NOCoE shows reduced gridlock.
- **Safety Focus**: Predictable flows prevent chaos; monitoring ensures compliance.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Playbooks reduce improvisation; regional programs demonstrate.

## Challenges
Requires coordination and prediction:
- **Surge Variability**: Real events differ from models; need robust triggers.
- **Staffing Needs**: Off-hours activation; NOCoE highlights staffing for incidents.
- **Integration**: With crowd management; temporary controls add complexity.

## Implementation Strategies
### Infrastructure Needs
- Event detection: Volume thresholds, parking data.
- Plan library: Inbound/outbound special timings.
- Twin for forecasting spillback.

### Detailed Implementation Plan
#### Phase 1: Event Inventory (Weeks 1-4)
- Identify events; map corridors.
- Team: Event planners.
- Budget: $40k.
- Risks: Incomplete coverage.
- Timeline: 4 weeks; Deliverable: Event catalog.

#### Phase 2: Plan Development (Weeks 5-12)
- Create library with contingencies.
- Team: Engineers.
- Budget: $120k.
- Risks: Ineffective plans.
- Timeline: 8 weeks; Deliverable: Plan sets.

#### Phase 3: Monitoring Setup (Weeks 13-20)
- Add triggers; twin testing.
- Team: Techs.
- Budget: $100k.
- Risks: False triggers.
- Timeline: 8 weeks; Deliverable: Monitoring system.

#### Phase 4: Activation Workflow (Weeks 21-32)
- Train operators; phased rollout.
- Team: Ops.
- Budget: $150k.
- Risks: Operator errors.
- Timeline: 12 weeks; Deliverable: Active mode.

#### Phase 5: Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)
- Update post-events; integrate AI.
- Budget: $70k annual.
- Timeline: Continuous.

### Choices
- **Manual**: Operator activation.
- **Semi-Auto**: Detection-assisted.
- **Pre-Scheduled**: Calendar-based.

## Future Impacts and Predictions
Event timings will cut clearance times by 30% in 5 years. In 15 years, AI predicts surges proactively.
