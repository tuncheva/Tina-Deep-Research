# Digital twin + smart signals — 20 ideas (short)

1) Green-Light “Wave” Plans — Coordinate lights so traffic gets consecutive greens on a corridor.
2) Self-Healing Intersections — Detect bad data/failures and fall back to a safe timing plan.
3) Real-Time “What If?” Button — Run quick near-term simulations to pick the best next timing.
4) City Rules Built Into Signals — Encode policy priorities as constraints the controller must obey.
5) Adapt to Local Driving Style — Calibrate timings to local behavior while enforcing safety guardrails.
6) Rare-Event Practice Mode — Rehearse detours/outages/special events in the twin and pre-pick plans.
7) Nature- and Noise-Friendly Signals — Smooth stop-and-go to reduce noise and protect sensitive areas.
8) Control-Room “Future Previews” — Present operators a few safe timing options with forecasts.
9) Fair Priority Credits — Allocate priority via a transparent budget instead of ad-hoc overrides.
10) Stop-Line Intent Coordination — Use turn intent to reduce wasted green and conflicts.
11) Delay-Tolerant Smart Signals — Keep stable control when sensors/comms are unreliable.
12) Privacy-Friendly Learning — Improve timing using aggregated or privacy-preserving data.
13) Red-Team the Signals — Simulate cyber/field attacks to harden defenses and fallbacks.
14) Weather + Traffic + Power Together — Coordinate signals for storms/outages using risk + constraints.
15) Anti-Jam “Nudges” — Predict spillback and adjust timings early to prevent gridlock.
16) Fast-Forward Twin (Next 5 Minutes) — Run many short rollouts to choose the best sequence.
17) Safety-First Signals — Optimize for safety metrics (near-misses) alongside delay.
18) Event-Aware Timing — Detect predictable surges and activate special timing plans.
19) Crowd-Smart Crossings — Adjust pedestrian phases when large groups are present.
20) Explainable Signals — Attach a short, auditable reason to each timing change.
